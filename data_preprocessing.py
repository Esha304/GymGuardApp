# Step 1: Load the dataset (replace 'your_dataset.csv' with your dataset file)
dataset = pd.read_csv('user_behavior_dataset.csv')

# Step 2: Data Preprocessing

# Separate features (input) and labels (output)
X = dataset.iloc[:, 1:]  # Assuming that the first column is not relevant for prediction
y = dataset.iloc[:, 0]   # Assuming that the first column contains the labels

# Normalize the features (scaling them between 0 and 1)
scaler = MinMaxScaler()
X = scaler.fit_transform(X)

# Split the dataset into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

X_train = X_train.reshape(X_train.shape[0], 1, X_train.shape[1])
# You can further preprocess and transform the data based on your specific requirements

# Step 3: Create and Compile the LSTM Model
model = keras.Sequential([
    keras.layers.LSTM(units=64, input_shape=(X_train.shape[1], X_train.shape[2])),
    keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
])


# Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

# Step 4: Train the Model
# Define the number of training epochs and batch size
epochs = 10
batch_size = 32

# Train the model
model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=epochs, batch_size=batch_size, validation_split=0.1)

# Step 5: Evaluate the Model (optional)
# ...

# Step 6: Save the Trained Model
# Save the model to a file
model.save('trained_lstm_model.keras')
